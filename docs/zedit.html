<h1>What is Zedit?</h1>

<p>Zedit is a simple terminal based text editor very loosely based on
Emacs.

<p>It supports multiple windows and multiple buffers.

<p>Editing commands are "bound" (assigned) to key sequences. These
sequences can be control key, function key, ALT key, or keypad key
combinations. A set of default bindings comes with the editor, but all
key bindings can be modified. This allows you to set up the editor the
way you want it.

<p>To allow further customization of Zedit, there are user variables that
allow you to change the workings of Zedit. For example, there is a
variable called "tabs" that controls the tab columns.

<p>You can get Zedit at <a
      href="https://github.com/smaclennan/zedit">https://github.com/smaclennan/zedit</a>.


<h2>Some Basic Terms</h2>

<p>A few terms need to be defined.

<p>A <b>buffer</b> is a collection of characters that can be manipulated with the
editor. A buffer is usually, but does not have to be, associated with a
file. A buffer called "*scratch*" is always created on startup. The number of
buffers is only limited by available memory.

<p>A buffer can be much larger than the size of a computer screen. A
<b>window</b> is the portion of the buffer that is displayed on the
screen. By moving the window over the buffer, the entire buffer can be
edited.

<p>Mulitple windows can be displayed on the screen at the same time. The
windows can display different buffers, or different sections of the same
buffer. Only one window is active at any one time. The active window has
the cursor in it.

<p>If a buffer line is greater than the width of the screen, Zedit will
continue the buffer line on the next screen line. The '>' character will
be displayed in the last column of the screen line to show the line has
wrapped. This character is not put in the buffer.

<p>The <b>Point</b> is the current location in the buffer. Every
buffer has its own Point. Most work on the buffer is done relative to
the Point. The Point is represented in the active window by the
cursor.

<p>Every buffer also has a user defined <b>Mark</b>, which is set with the Set
Mark command. The Mark is represented by a reverse video block on the
screen. The Mark is like a bookmark, it is used to keep track of a
specific place in a buffer.

<p>Hint: The Point and Mark are actually before the character they are
displayed on but after the previous character.

<p>The <b>Region</b> is all the characters in the buffer bounded by the
Mark and the Point. The Region can be before or after the Point. The
Region is used to work with blocks of text.


<h2>Invocation</h2>

<p>The easiest method of starting Zedit is to type "z" at the prompt. This
will start Zedit and put you in a buffer called *scratch*. If you want to
edit a specific file, "z filename" will start Zedit and load the file
into a buffer. More than one file can be specified, and wildcards are
supported. If more than one file is specified, Zedit will load all the
files into different buffers and make the first file specified the
active buffer.

<p>When a file is loaded into the buffer, the Point and Mark are set to the
beginning of the file. If the option "-l<line>" is specified, the Point
will be placed at the start of the given line or at the end of the
buffer is the line is not in the file. This only affects the buffer that
is made active at startup.

<p>The full Zedit command line can be seen with: <code>z -h</code>

<h2>The Status Line</h2>

<p>Each user window has a status line at the bottom. The status line is in
reverse video if supported by the terminal. The status line describes
the current status of the buffer in that window. A typical status line
is shown below:

<p><code>Zedit 5.0  (Text)  zedit.doc: /home/zedit/doc/zedit.doc *+   20:14</code>

	  <ol>
<li>"Zedit 5.0" is the version of Zedit
	    <li>"(Text)" is the current buffer
mode
	    <li> After the mode comes the buffer name. Every buffer must have a
unique buffer name of up to 15 characters. The main use of the buffer
name is for the Switch to Buffer command.

<li>After the buffer name comes the file name. A buffer does not have to
have a file name. This name is usually the name of the file read into
the buffer at startup or with the Find File command. If the file name is
too large to fit on the status line, it will be left truncated.

<li>The asterisk (*) means that the buffer has been modified. The exit
command, for example, uses this flag to decide whether to ask to save a
buffer.
	    <li>The plus sign (+) is the delete flag. See the "Kill Ring"
section for more detail on the delete flag and its use.

<li>20:14 are the line and column. This can be disabled with the Lines
variable.
</ol>

<h3>Major Modes</h3>

<p>Every buffer has one major mode and optionally one or more minor
modes. The major modes affect operations in the buffer and are mutually
exclusive. The major modes are: Normal, C, Shell, and Text. Normal is the
regular editing mode for the editor. Other modes are used to change the
normal operation of the editor.


<h4>C Mode</h4>

<p>In C mode, the Newline command (usually the Enter or Return key on the
keyboard) is bound to the C Indent command. This causes Newline to
auto-indent to the current tab level. If a Newline is hit after an open
brace ({), the next line is indented an extra tab stop. The close brace
(}) is bound to C Insert. This causes the close brace to line up with
the first unmatched open brace. C mode is automatically set if a file
ends in ".c", ".h", or ."y".

<p>C Mode also has "matching" capabilities. Zedit will "match" all ')'
and ']' with there matching '(' or '[' by moving the cursor to the
matching character temporarily.  If there is no match, Zedit will
beep.

<h4>Shell Mode</h4>

<p>Shell mode is a lot like C mode, except it expects shell type
comments.

<h4>Text Mode</h4>

<p>Text mode has word processing type features. In Text mode, the space bar
and Newline are bound to the Fill Check command. The Fill Check command
is used to wrap words that go past the FillWidth column and to indent to
a fixed right margin. The left margin is defined by the Margin variable.
The left margin does not affect the first line in the paragraph.

<p>The Fill Paragraph command can be used to clean up a paragraph. It uses
both the Margin and FillWidth variables to format the current paragraph.
A Universal Argument of zero (0) causes the command to reformat the
entire buffer. If a key is hit during a global reformat, the reformat
will abort at the end of the paragraph it is currently formatting.

<p>Text mode is turned on with the mode command or can be the
default if the variable Normal is turned off. It also gets turned on by
file names ending in any of the extensions specific by the textends
variable, usually ".txt".


<h3>Minor Modes</h3>

<p>Along with the major modes, the editor has three minor modes: view,
overwrite and exact. All or none of the minor modes can be active in a
given buffer.


<h4>View Mode</h4>

<p>View mode is set automatically for read only files. It is just a
hint that you cannot write the current file. You can use Write File to
write the file to another file name.

<h4>Overwrite Mode</h4>

<p>The editor is usually in insert mode. This means characters are
inserted at the Point, moving all the characters after the Point over
one character. The Point is left on the character it was originally on.
In overwrite mode, characters are placed over top of the character the
Point is on and the Point is moved forward one space. Overwrite mode is
set with the Insert/Overwrite command.

<p>In overwrite mode the word "Ovwrt" is displayed in the status line.

<h4>Exact Mode</h4>

<p>Exact specifies whether search/replace functions are to be case
sensitive. Searches are case sensitive by default. A search for the
string "string" will not match "String" or "STRING". If Exact is off,
then "string" will match "String", "STRING", "string", or "sTrInG". Case
insensitivity is set with the Toggle Case command. In Exact mode,
prompts that are case insensitive are displayed in uppercase. For
example, the prompt for a search string is usually "Search". If Exact is
off, it would be "SEARCH:".

<h2>Kill Buffer</h2>

<p>The kill buffer is a special buffer created by Zedit to store deleted or
copied text. This buffer does not show up in the buffer list and is
never saved.

<p>When text is deleted, it is placed in the kill buffer. If the delete
flag is set (a '+' in the status line), the text will be appended to the
kill buffer. If the delete flag is not set, the kill buffer will be
overwritten.

<p>The Yank command will yank the text from the kill buffer.


<h2>String Arguments and the PAW</h2>

<p>Various command require string arguments. For example, the
search command needs the string to search for. String arguments are
entered in the Prompt Argument Window (PAW). The PAW is a special one
line buffer that is on the last line of the display. The PAW is
restricted to this one line and will truncate past the end of this line.
The PAW is also used to display error and informational messages.

<p>Most of the editor commands are available in the PAW. Commands that
leave the current buffer or window, for example switch-to-buffer, or
commands that need the PAW, for example print-position, cannot be
executed in the PAW. The commands available in the PAW are marked with
a "P" in the flag for the command. Note that the again command is
marked as usable in the PAW. This is only true for the find-tag
command for partial matches. See section "tags" for more detail.

<p>String arguments may have optional defaults. For example, the
search command defaults to the last search string. When a string
argument has a default, the default is displayed in the PAW and the
Point is placed at the start of the default. If the Newline command is
executed, the default will be used. If a key bound to the Insert
Character, most ASCII characters not bound to a command, or the Get
Buffer Word commands is the first character entered in the PAW, the
default is deleted and the character, or word, entered. If any other
command is entered, the default is left in place and the command acts on
it.

<p>Three special cases of string arguments are Command Completion, "ask"
(yes/no) type prompts, and Incremental Search prompts. Command
Completion is explained in section 1.9.

<p>Yes/no "ask" type prompts usually end in a question mark (?) and expect a
yes/no response. Valid inputs to an "ask" prompt are Y, y, N, n, or the
Abort command. A bell will sound if an invalid key is hit. An example of
an "ask" type prompt is the question "Save buffer Main?" during the Exit
command.

<p>The Abort command always exits a prompt of any type except after a Quote
command.


<h2>Universal Argument</h2>

<p>Most commands in Zedit will respond to a Universal Argument. The
Universal Argument is a number that is entered in the PAW. Any non-digit
stops the Universal Argument and is executed as a command.

<p>Usually, a Universal Argument tells a command to execute more than once.
However, sometimes it is used to toggle the way a command works. The
help and command descriptions explain what the Universal Argument does
for each command.


<h2>Meta, C-X, and M-X</h2>

<p>Commands in Zedit are usually bound to control keys, however, there are
not enough control keys on a keyboard. To solve this problem, Zedit
employs prefix commands. A prefix command waits for another keystroke
and modifies the meaning of that keystroke. This allows a much wider set
of commands. Zedit has two prefix commands: Meta and C-X.

<p>For example, C-F goes forward one character, M-F goes forward one
word, C-X F goes forward one paragraph. The Meta key is the Esc key or
the Alt key. To execute M-F you would  type Esc and then F or just Alt +
F at the same time.

<p>The meta-x (M-X) command, allows any
Zedit command to be executed, even if it is not bound to a key. When the
meta-x command is executed, it prompts with "M-X:" and waits for a
command name. Hitting the Abort command will cancel the meta-x command.
A list of the valid commands is included in appendix A. When a
valid command is entered, it is executed normally. Any Universal
Argument is passed directly to the entered command.

<p>The meta-x command supports command completion. If you hit the tab
key, Zedit will complete the current word as much as possible. It will
also display all the matches.

<p>If the current word is unique, you can hit Return and it will be executed.
The editor will not allow you to hit Return if the command in the PAW is not unique.

<h1>Configuration File</h1>

<p>Zedit has an optional configuration file. Zedit will read up to
three configuration files in order:
<ol>
<li>/usr/share/zedit/.config.z
<li>~/.config.z
<li>./config.z
</ol>

<p>The config file is used to save the configuration variables which
allow customization of the editor. These variables are given defaults
by Zedit, can be assigned values in the config file, or can be
modified at run time with the set-variable command.

<p>The output from the Zedit command show-config is suitable to save
as a config file.

<p>The variable_name is one of the variables name shown in appendix B.
The space can be any number of spaces and/or tabs as long as there is
at least one space or tab. The variable is a number for DECIMAL or
FLAG variables and a string for STRING variables. STRING variables can
contain spaces. Each variable must be on a separate line. The
variables are case insensitive.

<p>You can also add bind commands to the configuration file. The format is:
<pre>bind &lt;keynum&gt; &lt;cmd&gt;</pre>
Where keynum is the actual number of the key in octal and cmd is
the command name. The help-key command displays the key
number. You can also do help-function on the notimpl command to see
all the unbound keys. Warning, there are a lot of them.

<h1>Commands</h1>

<p>Almost every key on the keyboard can be bound to a
command. Commands can be one or two keystrokes long. Commands that are
prefixed with C- are control commands. It means type the Ctrl key and
the key listed after the - at the same time.

<p>The command prefix C-X means to type Ctrl and X at the same time, then
type the sequence after it. For example, C-X C-A tells you to type Ctrl
and X at the same time, then to type Ctrl and A at the same time.

<p>The prefix M- means to hit the Meta key, then the key after it. The
Meta key can be Esc, in which case you type Esc then the next key
sequence. On most keyboards Meta is also the Alt key. The Alt key
works like the Ctrl key.

<p>So M-A could be Esc then A or Alt and A at the same time. Currently
all alphabetic prefix characters are case insensitive. So M-A and M-a
or C-X A and C-X a are the same thing.

<h2>Point Movement</h2>

<p>Aside from text input, Point movement is the most used feature of an
editor. Zedit has commands that move the point by characters, words,
lines, paragraphs, and buffer.

<p>On most terminals, the character Point movement will be done with the
arrow keys, however, control commands are included for terminals without
such keys.

<h2>Search Commands</h2>

<p>Zedit supports a wide variety of search and replace commands. There
are two basic types of searches: incremental and non-incremental.

<h3>Incremental Search</h3>

<p>The incremental-search command is used to find a match in the least
amount of key strokes. On every normal ASCII character entered, Zedit
will try to find a match for the current string in the PAW. If a match
is found, the Mark is displayed at this Point on the screen. If the
delete-previous-character command is executed, the previous character is
deleted in the PAW and the Mark is backed up to the last complete match.
A Universal Argument causes a reverse incremental search.

<p>C-S can be used to jump to the next match of the current string. Any
subsiquent input starts from this point.

<p>The Abort command can be executed to leave the incremental search and
return to the original Point. A Newline command terminates the search
and moves the Point to the match. Any other command causes the search to
terminate and that command to be immediately executed. The again command
can get executed to search again for the string.

<p>Assume the buffer contains the text "Do not panic." and that the Point
is currently on the "D" in "Do".

      <table>
<tr><th>User<th>PAW<th>Point
<tr><td>n<td>		n		<td>"n" in "not"
<tr><td>i		<td>ni		<td>"n" in "panic"
<tr><td>Backspace	<td>n		<td>"n" in "not"
</table>

<h3>Non-incremental Search</h3>

<p>There are three types of non-incrmental searches: literal,
regular expression, and global. All non-incremental searches work basically the
same way. The searches prompt for the search string (except for
word-search which defaults to the current word in the buffer) and then
search for the match. A Universal Argument searches for Arg matches. If
there are less than Arg matches, the point is left at the last match.

<p>The again command can be used with all of the searches to find the
next match. After the last match "Not Found" will be displayed in the
PAW. If you do another again after that, the again will wrap to the
start of the buffer and start over.

<p>The literal searches are performed by the search and reverse-search
commands. These commands are the most basic search.

<p>The regular expression searchs (re-search and global-re-search)
search for a regular expression rather than a literal string. Regular
expression searches only support searching forward through the buffer.

<p>The global searches are like their non-global counterparts except
that they search all the non-system buffers in the editor. This can give
you poor-man's grep.

<h2>Replace Commands</h2>

<p>There are two replace commands: query-replace and re-replace.
The query-replace command expects a literal search string while the
re-replace expects a regular expression search string. The replace
string for query-replace is also a literal, however the re-replace is a
literal with two exceptions. An '&' character in the replace string
causes the matched string to be placed in the buffer instead of the '&'
character itself. For example, if the search string was ".*", and the
replace string was "&&", all lines would be doubled. The escape
character '\' can be used to turn off this special meaning of the '&'.

<p>The replacement commands prompt for a search string and a replacement
string. For each occurrence of the search string, the user is prompted
for what they want to do with the string. The valid responses are:

	<table>
      <tr><th>Key<th>Action
<tr><td>,
<td>Replace current match and ask for confirmation. The confirmation is y/Y
to go ahead with the replace, or n/N to leave the string as it was.

<tr><td>y
<td>Replace current match and continue.

	    <tr><td>&lt;Space&gt;
	  <td>Replace current match and continue.

<tr><td>.
<td>Replace and exit.

<tr><td>!
<td>Replace this and all succeeding occurrences. The editor will no
longer prompt on each occurrence.

<tr><td>C-G (Abort)
<td>Exit without replacing current match.

<tr><td>Others
<td>Continue without replacing current match.
</table>

    <p>The commands are the same for both versions of the replace command.

<p>If a Universal Argument is given to a replace command, it performs a
global replace. Instead of performing the replace on the current Point
to the end of the current buffer, the replacement is performed on ALL of
the buffers in the buffer list.

<p>NOTE: You cannot search for or replace with a string that has a NULL
(ASCII 0) character in it.


<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>

<p>Zedit supports pattern matching using regular expressions
(REs).

<h3>Unix REs</h3>

<p>Zedit uses the standard regcomp()/regexec() functions
with REG_EXTENDED set. This is the same as the Unix egrep command.

<h3>Windows REs</h3>

<p>For Windows a much more reduced RE set is supported. This is more
like what the Unix grep command supports. The rules for Windows REs
are described below.

    <ul>
<li>An ordinary character matches itself.

<li>A period (.) matches any one character except Newline.

<li>A non-empty string of characters enclosed in square brackets ([])
matches any one of the characters in the string. If the first character
of the string is a caret (^), it matches any character except the
Newline and the characters in the string. The caret (^) has this special
meaning only if it occurs as the first character after the '['. The
minus (-) may be used to indicate a range of consecutive ASCII
characters; for example, [0-9] is equivalent to [0123456789]. The -
loses this special meaning if it occurs first (after an initial ^, if
any) or last in the string. The right square bracket (]) does not
terminate such a string when it is the first character within it (after
an initial ^, if any); e.g. []a-f] matches either a right square bracket
(]) or one of the characters a through f inclusive. None of the other
special characters are special inside the [].

<li>A backslash (\) escapes a special character.

<li>A one-character RE followed by an asterisk (*) matches zero or more
occurrences of the one-character RE. If there is any choice, the longest
leftmost string that permits a match is chosen.

<li>A one-character RE followed by \{m\}, \{m,\}, or \{m,n\} matches a range
of occurrences of the one-character RE. The values of m and n must be
positive integers less than 256; \{m\} matches exactly m occurrences;
\{m,\} matches at least m occurrences; \{m,n\} matches any number of
occurrences between m and n inclusive. Whenever a choice exists, the RE
matches as many occurrences as possible.

<li>The concatenation of REs is a RE that matches the concatenation of
the strings matched by each component.

<li>A RE enclosed between the character sequences \\( and \\) is a RE that
matches whatever the unadorned RE matches.

<li>The expression \\n matches the same string of characters as was
matched by an expression enclosed between \\( and \\) earlier in the same
RE. Here n is a digit; the sub-expression specified is that beginning
with the n-th occurrence of \\( counting from the left. For example, the
expression ^\\(.*\\)\\1$ matches a line consisting of two repeated
appearances of the same string.

<li>A caret (^) at the beginning of an entire RE constrains that RE to match
an initial segment of a line.

<li>A dollar sign ($) at the end of an entire RE constrains that RE to match
a final segment of a line.
</ul>

<h2>Tag Files</h2>

<p>Tag files are a list of tags, usually function names, and their
associated file name and position in the file. Tag files allow files to
be found by function names instead of file names.

<p>Zedit does not produce the tag files. They must be created by an
external program. The only tag file format supported is etags.

<p>The tag or tag-word command is used to look for a tag in the tags file. If it
finds the tag, it sets a bookmark at the current Point, performs a find-file
with the matched filename, and positions the Point in the opened
file. The first time the tag command command is executed, it creates the
"*tags*" buffer and loads the tags file. The tag file is only
re-loaded if the file is modified.

<p>The tag commands look for a TAGS file in the current directory. If
it is not found, Zedit will prompt for the filename.  A Universal
Argument will always prompt for the tag file to read.

<h2>Mouse Support</h2>

<p>Zedit is finally getting some mouse support.

<ol>
<li>The left button sets the point
<li>The right button sets the mark
<li>You can drag to set the region
<li>The scroll wheel should scroll
</ol>

<p>Now what is supported where:

<ul>
<li>Xterm supports everything and requires no libraries.
<li>Rxvt supports everything except drag (3) and requires no libraries.
<li>The Linux console supports everything but requires gpm.
<li>Win32 supports everything except drag (3). Drag is probably doable.
<li>DOS supports only simple button presses (1 & 2).
</ul>
