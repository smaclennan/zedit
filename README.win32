Zedit is supported as a console app for Microsoft Windows. It has the
following differences from the Unix version:

 * Reduced regular expression support. grep rather than egrep support.
 * Compression not supported (disabled in Unix by default).
 * Spelling not supported (disabled in Unix by default).
 * Simple mouse support always enabled (disabled in Unix by default).
 * Mouse dragging not supported.

The windows version supports Unix globing using the Unix fnmatch()
command.
