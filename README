Zedit - A Short History
-----------------------

Back in 1988 I was using three editors on a daily basis. One for the
bulk of my editing, one for regular expressions, and one for large
files (memory maps mainly). I had access to an unused Unix workstation
so I started writing an Emacs like editor I called Zedit.

Once it was usable under Unix, I ported it to DOS and it became my
only editor.

The DOS version became fairly full-featured. In 1990 I joined
Toolsmiths and switched to Sun computers. Zedit grew and a raw X11
version and later a slightly better looking version where created.

In 1996 I joined Pika and didn't have the energy to port Zedit to
Windows NT, so it languished. I switched to GNU Emacs and then
XEmacs.

But it has morphed back into a nice little terminal only editor to use
for those quick edits of config files. Or for low powered machines.

About the Name
--------------

The program is called Zedit, but the executable was always z. I liked
the fact that if you say z the British/Canadian way (zed not zee) it
has the word ed in it but only needs one letter.

So why does the Makefile produce ze? Zedit was my main editor. So z
was the stable version and ze was the experimental version. If I
broke ze, I still had z to edit with.

Mouse Support
-------------

Zedit is finally getting some mouse support. Let's first describe what
we are trying to support and then mention what is supported where.

  1. The left button sets the point.
  2. The right button sets the mark.
  3. You can drag to set the region.
  4. The scroll wheel should scroll.

* Xterm supports everything and requires no libraries.
* Rxvt supports everything except drag (3) and requires no libraries.
* The Linux console supports everything but requires gpm.
* Win32 supports everything except drag (3). Drag is probably doable.
* DOS supports only simple button presses (1 & 2).
